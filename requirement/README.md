# Pipes

In this requirement you are required to extend your `cmpsh` to support pipes. It should be able to direct one program's output to another program's input using `pipe`.
```bash
ls | wc
```

Thanks for folks at UC Berkley for this amazing guide. Check this guide for more info: [UC Berkley CS 162](https://cs162.org/static/hw/hw-shell/docs/pipes/)

You should implement this as part of Lab 4 assignment, more tests will be uploaded to cmp-shell covering cases with pipes. Take it in consideration while building your shell.
